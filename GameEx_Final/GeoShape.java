 * This interface represents a (very basic) geometric (2D) shape in the plane.
 * The methods includes: translating the shape on both x and y axes, testing if
 * two shapes are intersected, getting and setting the change of x/y direction
 * to be applied on the shape, and draw the shape on a given component.
 * 
 * Ex4: you should NOT change this interface!
